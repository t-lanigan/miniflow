# MiniFlow

A library written in python that simulates the graph operation of Tensorflow for building neural networks.

## Dependancies 

In order to use MiniFlow the following libraries must be installed:

* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)

In order to run some of the examples please install:

* [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

Both can be installed using pip.

## How to Use

To run the code, choose an example file with the prefix 'nn' and run it using python (eg. `python nn_sgd.py`). For example, the file 'nn_sgd.py' runs a simple neural network with 1 hidden layer, sigmoid activation and mean square error for the loss function. It uses stochastic gradient descent to update its weight and bias values.

The other 'nn' files show different examples of MiniFlow use. 

This is an on-going project, used to learn and understand TensorFlow. Feel free to contribute. Thanks to Udacity for providing the learning experience nessesary to develop this library.
